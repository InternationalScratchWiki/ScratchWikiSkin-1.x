# ScratchWikiSkin-1.x
This is the skin used on the Scratch Wiki prior to the release of Scratch 2.0.
This repository is provided for archival purposes only and is not under active development.
Additionally, this skin is not currently in use on any active Scratch Wiki nor is the current skin a direct descendant of this one.
As of September 2021, [ScratchWikiSkin2](https://github.com/InternationalScratchWiki/ScratchWikiSkin2) is the current skin in use on all Scratch Wikis.

## Compatibility and Usability
The skin as provided here was designed to work with MediaWiki 1.15 and will not work out of the box with more modern versions.
Even making it work with MediaWiki 1.15 will require significant modification, in particular with regards to paths of files like the CSS stylesheet and images.
The images from scratchr.org are in the scratchr.org-images folder.

## Credits
This skin is believed to originally be developed by [Joren Lauwers](https://github.com/jorenl), [JSO](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/JSO/) on Scratch.

## Modernized Version
For a modified version of this skin that works on MediaWiki 1.36, see [this repository](https://github.com/Mrcomputer1/ScratchWikiSkin-1.x-Updated) by [Mrcomputer1](https://github.com/Mrcomputer1/).
